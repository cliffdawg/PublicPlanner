Throughout my life, every meeting or outing with a group presented the simple yet unexpectedly challenging problem of organizing around our schedules. I realized that people needed an efficient and streamlined way to accomplish that task. From this desire, Public Planner came into existence. Public Planner lets users create their own personal schedule and upload it online. After adding friends, they will all be able to view that schedule, allowing friends to coordinate outings with each other, see when they are free, and openly announce their own events, making their life much easier to handle.
